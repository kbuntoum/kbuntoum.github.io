  <h3>A little about me </h3>
  <p>I am currently on my 3-4th year of college on my way in getting a degree in Computer Systems Game Development. I have a very
  negative view on life where I usually feel that alot of things never really seem to go my way. Which is what gave me my love for video
   games they immerse me in a reality that is not the one that I live in. I can be a knight fighting during medival times with an alien invading the planet
   with my pet dragon fighting alongside carrying a photon laser cannon.... lol imagination runs wild, but I love it.</p>
