  <h3>A Little About me </h3>
  <p>I am currently on my 3-4th year of college on my way in getting a degree in Computer Systems Game Development. I have a very
  negative view on life where I usually feel that alot of things never really seem to go my way. Which is what gave me my love for video
   games they immerse me in a reality that is not the one that I live in. I can be a knight fighting during medival times with an alien invading the planet
   with my pet dragon fighting alongside carrying a photon laser cannon.... lol imagination runs wild, but I love it.<a href="https://www.walldevil.com/825464-medieval-warrior-meets-future-soldier-wallpaper.html">Picture from walldevil.com uploader: kleberrise</a>

  <h3>My Dreams </h3>
  <p>What a dream is to me is my desires and what I desire to one day come true. I desire to live a life that can make the people around me
   remember me. To one day become Immortal not by living but by being forever remembered. I want to make a game one that will tell my story where people
   that play it can see through what I saw when I was a kid to how I am now. I want to teach a lesson that one will never forget. I want to be Immortal.</p>
  
  <h3>Website Design<h3>
    <p>This quarter I taken a course in website design and I got to say that as much as I enjoyed it. Not knowing my grade for the entire
     quarter has really stressed me.</p>
